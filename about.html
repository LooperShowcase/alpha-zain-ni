      Rockstar Games, Inc. is an American video game publisher based in New York
      City. The company was established in December 1998 as a subsidiary of
      Take-Two Interactive, using the assets Take-Two had previously acquired
      from BMG Interactive. Founding members of the company were Sam and Dan
      Houser, Terry Donovan and Jamie King, who worked for Take-Two at the time,
      and of which the Houser brothers were previously executives at BMG
      Interactive. Sam Houser heads the studio as president. Since 1999, several
      companies acquired by or established under Take-Two have become part of
      Rockstar Games, such as Rockstar Canada (later renamed Rockstar Toronto)
      becoming the first one in 1999, and Rockstar Dundee the most recent in
      2020. All companies organized under Rockstar Games bear the "Rockstar"
      name and logo. In this context, Rockstar Games is sometimes also referred
      to as Rockstar New York, Rockstar NY or Rockstar NYC. Rockstar Games also
      sports a motion capture studio in Bethpage, New York. Rockstar Games
      predominantly publishes games in the action-adventure genre, while racing
      games also saw success for the company. One of such action-adventure game
      franchises is Grand Theft Auto, which Rockstar Games took over from BMG
      Interactive, which published the series' original 1997 entry. The most
      recent game in the series, Grand Theft Auto V, has sold over 155 million
      copies since its release in September 2013, making it one of the
      best-selling video games of all time. Other popular franchises published
      by Rockstar Games are Red Dead, Midnight Club, Max Payne and Manhunt.
